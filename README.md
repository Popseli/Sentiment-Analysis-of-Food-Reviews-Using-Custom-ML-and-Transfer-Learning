# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to evaluate and compare the sentiment prediction of various supervised custom machine-learning algorithms and an unsupervised pre-trained sentiment prediction model. In this project, we use Kaggle's dataset of [Amazon's fine food reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) for the analysis. The pre-trained sentiment prediction model used is a version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) fine-tuned for sentiment analysis of product reviews.
# Methodology
The dataset consists of two important columns which are Summary and Review for each records
