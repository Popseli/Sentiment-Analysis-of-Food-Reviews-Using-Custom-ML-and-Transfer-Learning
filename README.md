# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to evaluate and compare the sentiment prediction of various supervised custom machine-learning algorithms and an unsupervised pre-trained sentiment prediction model. In this project, we use Amazon's fine food review for the analysis. The pre-trained sentiment prediction model used is Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a version of the transformer-based model which is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis of product reviews.
